- Marker Interfaces are special kind of interfaces which have no methods or other
nested constructs defined. 
- Marker Interfaces are not contracts per se by somewhat useful technique to "attach"
 or "tie" some particular trait to the class. Foe eg., with respect to Cloneable, 
the class is marked as being abailable for cloning however the way it should or 
could be done is not a part of the interface.

public interface Serializable{
    
}
- This interface marks the class as being available for serialization and 
deserialization, and again, it does not specify the way it could or should be
done.
